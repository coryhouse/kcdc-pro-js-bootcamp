# Pro JavaScript Bootcamp

To follow along, do this **before** the conference:

1. Install [Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/) if on Mac or Linux. Install Node [5.11.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) if on Windows.  
2. Clone or download the [completed starter kit](https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter). Note that this starter kit includes React but **this precompiler strives to teach general principles. You don't need to know React**.
3. Follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter#get-started). You can skip step 6, since it's specific to React.
4. If you can run the app, then you’re all set. We’re going to build this development environment from the ground up during the precompiler. You can use this as an easy reference along the way. This is the finished product.
